# Hangman
Hangman is an basic android game which is based on the paper and pencil word guessing game. But there is a twist, the user cannot win (well most of the times). This version of Hangman is called Evil Hangman. It is called evil because the computer cheats here. Instead of choosing a word, the computer takes all words in dictionary into consideration. And whenever the user guesses a letter, the computer removes all the words with that letter from its dictionary, giving very slim chance to the user to win.
It is my final project for the "Android with CS" course by Google.
