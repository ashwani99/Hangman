    <string name="instructions">Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers, within a certain number of guesses.\n\nEvil Hangman is a twisted version of Hangman. Once you guess a letter, the computer tries to neglect all the words with that letter. YES IT CHEATS! That is probably why this game is so tough :D\n\nI hope you WIN someday :P\n\nAll the best and if you do WIN, take time to pat your back! Yeah, that\'s an achievement. :P
